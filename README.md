# Inter-IIT-Tournament-Management-System
This project is a part of Software Engineering Lab, IIT Guwahati, in which we followed complete software development life cycle.
About the project-
This software system is a Management System for the
organizer, team managers and participants of the Inter-IIT Sports Tournament.
This system will be designed to efficiently organize, manage and to inform
about different events that occur during the Inter-IIT Tournament by
providing them tools to assist in automating the entire process such as
room allocation to participants, scheduling event timings,responding to
queries and many more, which would otherwise have to be performed
manually. By efficiently organizing and managing, the system will save time
and resources which will meet the needs of all while remaining easy to use
and understand.
