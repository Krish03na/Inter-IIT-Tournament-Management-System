# Inter-IIT-Tournament-Management-System
This project is a part of CS346 Software Engineering Lab, IIT Guwahati, which involved developement of ```Management System for the Inter IIT Tournament``` which occurs every year which will be used by participants, team managers and admin. <br/>
## About the project<br/>  
This is a Management System for the
organizer, team managers and participants of the Inter-IIT Sports Tournament.
This system was designed to efficiently organize, manage and to inform
about different events that occur during the Inter-IIT Tournament by
providing them tools to assist in automating the entire process such as
room allocation to participants, scheduling event timings,responding to
queries and many more, which would otherwise have to be performed
manually. By efficiently organizing and managing, the system would save time
and resources which would meet the needs of all while remaining easy to use
and understand.  



## Development Stages
The development of the system was planned in 4 modules - <br/>
- Software Requirement Specification    
  The main aim of this module was about gathering information from the end user. The information gathered was about the ```functional requirements``` of the system along with the  ```Contextual Inquiry ``` which documented the difficulties or lack of feature faced by the user while observing on similar type of platform. The interaction with a end user was arranged via video conference and the user was observed from our end while interacting with a similar type of platform. After observing, an affinity diagram was made which highlighted the aspects which we need to be looked while the development.

- Design   
  This module involved the designing of the system where the design of the system was made through ```DFD (Data Flow Diagram)``` was shown. The design of the system was shown in ```3 levels of DFD diagrams``` through which the code implementation was to be proceeded . Each level of the diagram consisted of elaborated data flow into several modules of the system for different types of user which are Student, Team Manager and Admin in this case.  Along with an ```ER``` diagram was made for the database which was to be used by the system.

- Prototype and Cognitive Walkthrough  
  In this module, a ```medium level vertical prototype``` of the management system was made with the help of AdobeXD software. After development of prototype, a ```cognitive walkthrough``` process was conducted with end user which helped us to examine the ```usabilty``` of our prototype and redesign the the prototype to suite the demands that were observed during the process.

- Code Implementation and Testing  
  In this module, a ```high level prototype``` was implemented for android based platform for a ```single module``` according to the design document of Module 2. After implementation, code testing was conducted.
